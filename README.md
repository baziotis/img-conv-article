This is some sample code for the article [A Beginner's Guide to Vectorization By Hand: Part 4 - Convolution](https://sbaziotis.com/performance/a-beginners-guide-to-vectorization-by-hand-part-4-convolution.html). This is simplified educational code and it's not industrial-strength quality. This code is derivative of the code in the repo [2D-Image-Convolution-MPI-SIMD](https://github.com/baziotis/2D-Image-Convolution-MPI-SIMD). Refer there for higher quality code and handling of edge cases.
